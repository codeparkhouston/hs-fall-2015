# Before Class

Hello,

We had a lot fun being robots in class today.

As mentioned, here is the [**video lesson**](http://codeparkhouston.com/hs-fall-2015/lesson-01/exercise/) for you to watch before Thursday's class.

If you missed class today, we look forward to meeting you Thursday! Be sure to watch the video, and you'll be ready to go.

See you next class!
