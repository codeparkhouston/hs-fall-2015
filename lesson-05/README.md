# Variables Game and Scrabble Project Continued

1. Review variables by playing a game
1. Work through [examples of using variables](https://gist.github.com/pandafulmanda/dbfc37059ef74cc19e57)
1. Work with the students to finish the [Scrabble project from last time](https://github.com/codeparkhouston/hs-fall-2015/blob/lesson-04/assets/scrabble.js)


### Variable game instructions

Each student will get a bucket
  * write a name on the bucket
  * put something that will fit in the bucket

Teachers each write a couple mad libs
  * label the blanks with names from buckets
  * students read madlibs outloud
    * with the blanks filled out with what the buckets are holding

Then, we relate back to variable syntax:
  * `var someBucket;`
    * Like naming a bucket
    * Called "declaring a variable"
  * `someBucket = 'something'`
    * Like setting 'something' in the bucket named someBucket
    * Called "assigning a variable"
  * `someBucket`
    * Like when you grab a bucket and see what it's holding
  * `var someBucket = 'something'`
    * Can declare and assign in one step
  * `someBucket = 'something else'`
    * Like when you change your mind and put something new in the bucket

Emphasize, whenever something is before the 'equals' sign, it's a variable name and it holds values.  The stuff after the equals sign is the value.  Whenever you see a variable name by itself, you can replace it with the value it holds.
