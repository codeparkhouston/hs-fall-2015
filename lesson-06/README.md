# Plan

1. Finish the Scrabble project
  * As they finish/after they finish the Scrabble project, we should challenge our students to explain what their code does.  If they struggle, it's okay. Let them know that we'll get back to it after we review.
1. Review
  * concepts
    * Variables
    * Functions
    * Functions with parameters
  * For each of these, we should ask and review:
    * What it is
    * Why/when would we use them
    * How to write one/assign/set the value of one
    * How to get/call/use it after

With functions, make sure they understand the difference between
  * Functions that returns values
  * Functions that change other values

Practice with the student until they can use these concepts on their own.  Continue practicing with them until they've written several different functions that use parameters, both to return values, and to change values.
